# Collaborative Filtering Recommender System with PyTorch

## Overview

This project implements a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System using PyTorch. The goal is to recommend items to users based on their historical preferences and behaviors.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and analysis.
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for data preprocessing and exploration.
  - `Collaborative_Filtering_Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook containing the model training process.
  - `Collaborative_Filtering_Inference.ipynb`: Notebook for making recommendations.

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the Collaborative Filtering model.
  - `collaborative_filtering_model.py`: Python script defining the PyTorch model architecture.
  - `train.py`: Python script for training the Collaborative Filtering model.
  - `predict.py`: Python script for making recommendations using the trained model.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- NumPy
